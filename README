This is an implementation of the Token Ring protocol for reliable multicast messaging. It runs for a maximum of 10
machines in a multicast group where each machine transmits approxmately 100,000 messages. The recv_dbg.c is a routine that
simulates message loss. We handle reliable multicast with message delivery in SAFE order despite omissions. 


This repo contains the following files: 

1. mcast.c - Our protocol for multicasting messages
2. start_mcast.c - The program that signals mcast.c to run 
3. get_ip.c - This is a small piece of code that returns the machine's IP address. We have used stackoverflow for this code- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2021549/how-do-i-output-my-host-s-ip-addresses-from-a-c-program
4. recv_dbg.c recv_dbg.h - The receive routines that were provided to us. They receive with omissions.
5. net_include.h - header file and definition of our data structures  

** We have modified recv_dbg.c to have an increased timeout as our protocol runs slowly on losses. Although we have set it to 1200 seconds, it almost always is bounded by 500 seconds for 20% loss.
